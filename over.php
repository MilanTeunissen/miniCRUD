            <p>We are 6 students from ROC Technovium of which 3 come from the Software Developer course and the other 3 from the Media and Design course. In this project we have been given the assignment to program a Lego EV3 robot using the programming language Python. According to the assignment, the robot must be able to do a few things: follow a black line with curves in it, do something with a red line where there is an obstacle, and when there is a green dot on the ground, it must stop driving and make a noise to let people know it has stopped. fortunately, a lot of the documentation can be found online and there are many useful guides on YouTube.</p>
